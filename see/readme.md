# Simple plugin that adds the 'see allies outline' via TFCond_SpawnOutline  
This is what you for 10 seconds immediately upon respawning  
This just makes the effect permanent via !see  @target (1/0)  
There is a bug that disabling this also removes the default 10 second behaviour, cba fixing that  
This is overidden by client side settings if they have the glow setting disabled
